## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/He-Q/ob_i.git
```

Or download as ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

  

## Step 2: Download Obsidian

- Go to [https://obsidian.md/](https://obsidian.md/)

- Download and install Obsidian for your operating system

  

## Step 3: Open the Vault in Obsidian

1. Launch Obsidian

2. Click "Open folder as vault" (or "Open" if you see that option)

3. Navigate to the `ob_i` folder you just cloned/extracted

4. Select the folder and click "Open"

  

## Step 4: Trust the Plugins

When Obsidian opens the vault, you'll see a popup asking about community plugins:

- Click "Trust author and enable plugins"

- Or you can review the plugins first and enable them individually

  

## Step 5: Enjoy Your Vault!

The vault should now be fully functional with all its plugins and configurations.
To make the most of this setup, it is highly recommended that you do the following:
 
 **Review Plugin Settings:** Go through the settings page for each plugin you installed. This will help you understand what each one does.
 
 **Learn the Hotkeys:** The most important reason to check the settings is to see what **hotkeys** (keyboard shortcuts) are assigned to the key functions of each plugin. Knowing these shortcuts will dramatically speed up your workflow.
