GET SMARTER SECTION:
A quick clarification....
It took me 8 months to learn how to do this, but I was only picking up the bike and running to the end of the driveway and back every day.  I wasn't "ACTIVELY" trying to learn.  Meaning... I wasn't struggling and trying to make my brain learn.  I simply got on the bike every day, tried to operate it to the end of the driveway, turned around and tried to operate it back.  The goal was to understand how my brain figured things out on its own, without trying to force it to.  Many people have built bikes like this and figured it out in much less than 1 day by staying on the bike until they were able to master it.  I had no timelines, and was using this as an exploratory activity to learn how I learn.

Do not misinterpret this to mean that I struggled and tried very hard every day for 8 months.  That's simply not true.
