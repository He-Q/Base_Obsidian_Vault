# Gradient Descent, Step-by-Step

![thumbnail|250](https://img.youtube.com/vi/sDv4f4s2SB8/maxresdefault.jpg)

```
Gradient Descent is the workhorse behind most of Machine Learning. When you fit a machine learning method to a training dataset, you're probably using Gradient Descent. It can optimize parameters in a wide variety of settings. Since it's so fundamental to Machine Learning, I decided to make a "step-by-step" video that shows you exactly how it works.

NOTE: This video assumes you are already familiar with Least Squares and Linear Regression. If not, here's the link to the Quest: https://youtu.be/PaFPbb66DxQ

There are a ton of websites that describe the math behind Gradient Descent. One of my favorite is the wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent
