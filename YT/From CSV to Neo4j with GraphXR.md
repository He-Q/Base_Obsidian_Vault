```
The CSV mapping editor is one of GraphXR's most powerful tools and it's especially handy if you're just getting started with Neo4j. In this video, we'll cover how to:

- Set up and start a Neo4j DB
- Map a CSV to the Graph
- Add new properties with Transforms
- Write the graph to Neo4j

If you'd like to follow along, the dataset is available at
