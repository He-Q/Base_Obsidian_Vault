# Neural Networks Part 6: Cross Entropy

![thumbnail|250](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6ArSys5qHAU/maxresdefault.jpg)

```
When a Neural Network is used for classification, we usually evaluate how well it fits the data with Cross Entropy. This StatQuest gives you and overview of how to calculate Cross Entropy and Total Cross Entropy.

NOTE: This StatQuest assumes that you are already familiar with...
The main ideas behind neural networks: https://youtu.be/CqOfi41LfDw
The main ideas behind backpropagation: https://youtu.be/IN2XmBhILt4
Neural networks with multiple inputs and outputs: https://youtu.be/83LYR-1IcjA
ArgMax and SoftMax: https://youtu.be/KpKog-L9veg
