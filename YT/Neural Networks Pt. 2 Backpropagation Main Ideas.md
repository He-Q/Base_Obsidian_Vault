# Neural Networks Pt. 2: Backpropagation Main Ideas

![thumbnail|250](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IN2XmBhILt4/maxresdefault.jpg)

```
Backpropagation is the method we use to optimize parameters in a Neural Network. The ideas behind backpropagation are quite simple, but there are tons of details. This StatQuest focuses on explaining the main ideas in a way that is easy to understand.

NOTE: This StatQuest assumes that you already know the main ideas behind...

Gradient Descent: https://youtu.be/sDv4f4s2SB8

LAST NOTE: When I was researching this 'Quest, I found this page by Sebastian Raschka to be helpful: https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/backprop-arbitrary.html
