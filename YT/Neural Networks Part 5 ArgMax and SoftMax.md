# Neural Networks Part 5: ArgMax and SoftMax

![thumbnail|250](https://img.youtube.com/vi/KpKog-L9veg/maxresdefault.jpg)

```
When your Neural Network has more than one output, then it is very common to train with SoftMax and, once trained, swap SoftMax out for ArgMax. This video give you all the details on these two methods so that you'll know when and why to use ArgMax or SoftMax.

NOTE: This StatQuest assumes that you already understand:
The main ideas behind Neural Networks: https://youtu.be/CqOfi41LfDw
How Neural Networks work with multiple inputs and outputs: https://youtu.be/83LYR-1IcjA
