# Neural Networks Pt. 1: Inside the Black Box

![thumbnail|250](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CqOfi41LfDw/maxresdefault.jpg)

```
Neural Networks are one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, but they are also one of the most poorly understood. Everyone says Neural Networks are "black boxes", but that's not true at all. In this video I break each piece down and show how it works, step-by-step, using simple mathematics that is still true to the algorithm. By the end of this video you will have a deep understanding of what Neural Networks do.
