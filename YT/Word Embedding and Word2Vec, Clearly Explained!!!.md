# Word Embedding and Word2Vec, Clearly Explained!!!

![thumbnail|250](https://img.youtube.com/vi/viZrOnJclY0/maxresdefault.jpg)

```
	Words are great, but if we want to use them as input to a neural network, we have to convert them to numbers. One of the most popular methods for assigning numbers to words is to use a Neural Network to create Word Embeddings. In this StatQuest, we go through the steps required to create Word Embeddings, and show how we can visualize and validate them. We then talk about one of the most popular Word Embedding tools, word2vec. BAM!!!

Note, this StatQuest assumes that you are already familiar with...
