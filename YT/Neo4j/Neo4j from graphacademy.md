## Domain model for this course

Here is the data model used in this course. The graph contains nodes with the labels _Person_ and _Movie_. _Person_ nodes have several types of relationships to _Movie_ nodes. A _Person_ node can have a _FOLLOWS_ relationship to another _Person_ node.

### Writing Data to Neo4j

In this module you will learn how to update the graph using Cypher and the Movies example dataset.

You will learn to:

Use MERGE to create nodes in the graph.

Use MERGE to create relationships in the graph.

Create, update and remove properties for nodes and relationships in the graph.

Perform conditional MERGE processing, depending on what is in the graph.

Delete nodes and relationships from the graph.
