"Accounting is like a superpower," says Kelly Richmond Pope. 

As a forensic accounting expert, Pope understands how this power comes with significant responsibilities and potential pitfalls. The pressure from market expectations can sometimes drive companies to inflate their financial performance, creating a precarious ethical landscape for the accounts overseeing the company’s financial activity.

Pope highlights a key problem area: the mismatch between the money a company actually has (cash) and the money it records as earned (revenue). In the wrong hands, this system can be exploited, leading to serious legal consequences. 

She emphasizes that accountants often face hard choices and must stand firm in their ethics to ensure transparency and fairness in business.
