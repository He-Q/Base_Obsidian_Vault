# Transformer Neural Networks, ChatGPT's foundation, Clearly Explained!!!

![thumbnail|250](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zxQyTK8quyY/maxresdefault.jpg)

```
Transformer Neural Networks are the heart of pretty much everything exciting in AI right now. ChatGPT, Google Translate and many other cool things, are based on Transformers. This StatQuest cuts through all the hype and shows you how a Transformer works, one-step-at-a time.
