 HOTKEY USED:
	- Open video player (copy video url and use hotkey) : Ctrl + <-
	- Insert timestamp based on videos current play time : Alt + T



I demonstrated in this note [[Understanding classes and object-oriented programming Python Tutorial]] 

How I use both the [[Timestamp Notes (YouTube)]] plugin and the [[Execute Code]] plugin together to take and organize notes more effectively.
